# Earth Data Science Final Project Proposal

## By Haley Crim and Rey Lautenschlager

### Question
How do local climates in the U.S. vary at different levels of global warming?

### Methods
Using temperature and precipitation data at the county level from the 5th National Climate Assessment, we will visually and statistically analyze the projected trends in temperature and precipitation for warming of 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 degrees across the United States. We will compare temperature and precipitation projections for different spatial areas around the country and across different warming scenarios. These analyses and visualizations will allow us to understand specific changes in temperature or precipitation across areas and how these changes differ depending on warming scenario.
